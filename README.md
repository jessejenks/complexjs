# ComplexJs
---
Hey Lars, so Complexjs is a library for complex numbers. Complex numbers are, of course built into almost any math library, but this focuses on implementing the Riemann Zeta function based on [this paper](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~pmenz/thesis.pdf). Another good source I found was [this one](http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Miscellaneous/zetaevaluations.pdf).

The main problems right now are implementing the Gamma function and the derivative of the Gamma function / Zeta. Although I think that's a lot easier than implementing zeta in the first place
